  ABSTRACT    = {We bestuderen een leermethode voor eindige spelen in de strategische vorm. Hierbij maken de spelers gebruik van een geschiedenis van reeds gespeelde sessies om inschattingen te maken over de waarschijnlijke strategiekeuze van een tegenspeler. Op die waarschijnlijk geachte strategiekeuze baseren de spelers zich om een eigen strategie te kiezen. We bestuderen hiervoor eerst de wetenschapsdiscipline genaamd speltheorie. We gaan hier in op kenmerkende elementen van spelen en bekijken mogelijke voorstellingswijzen. We gaan dieper in op de voorstelling van een spel in de strategische vorm. Een strategie, een geheel aan regels die de keuze van acties binnen een spel volledig bepalen, en de opbrengstfunctie, die de uitslag van een spel voor de speler vastlegt, worden gedefinieerd. We bekijken hoe we de strategieën van een spel kunnen onderverdelen en welke strategieën optimaal zijn voor een speler. Zo komen we tot volgende concepten: beste antwoord, wat de verzameling van strategieën is die de opbrengst van de speler maximaliseert voor een gegeven strategie van zijn tegenspeler; evenwicht, wat een strategiecombinatie is waar geen enkele speler er voordeel bij heeft om van strategie te veranderen; dominantie, wat een methode is om strategieën te identificeren die het best niet gespeeld worden en maximin-strategie, wat een voorzichtige strategiekeuze is. In tweede instantie bespreken we imprecieze waarschijnlijkheden, wat een onzekerheidsmodel is waar niet alleen rekening kan worden gehouden met onzekerheid, maar ook met onbepaaldheid. We gaan in op de gevolgen van rationaliteitvereisten voor dit model en zijn rekenregels. Er wordt tevens een interpretatie op basis van gokgedrag gegeven aan de grootheden die we gebruiken om waarschijnlijkheden uit te drukken. Voortbouwend op het voorgaande wordt onderzocht hoe we een beslissing kunnen maken tussen keuzes voor verschillende mogelijke strategieën. Dit leidt tot de definitie van maximale strategieën, die goede keuzes zijn voor een speler. Deze beslissingen worden gebaseerd op het Dirichletmodel, dat inschattingen weergeeft over de strategiekeuze van een tegenspeler. We leggen ook uit hoe dit model bijgesteld kan worden door verrekening van de informatie bekomen uit reeds gespeelde sessies. Door het voorgaande te combineren kunnen we de beoogde leermethode formuleren. We maken hier een onderscheid tussen een precieze methode, waarbij er geen rekening wordt gehouden met eventuele onbepaaldheid en twee imprecieze methodes, waarbij dit wel gebeurt. Uiteindelijk bekijken we de dynamica van de leermethode, namelijk de evolutie van de inschattingen van spelers en de door hen gespeelde strategieën. We onderzoeken voornamelijk onder welke voorwaarden er enkel convergentie naar een evenwicht zal optreden.},

  ABSTRACT    = {This text treats of the problem of predicting the flow of a river using past flow measurements, rainfall measurements and rainfall predictions. The objective is to generalize a forecasting method already used to predict daily consumption of electricity. The developed method will be compared to Hydromax, an existing riverflow forecasting model. The developed method simultaneously generates a series of consecutive flow predictions called a flow curve. This is done by combining separate forecasts for the mean, standard deviation and the normalized profile of the flow curve. Therefore, three separate forecasting models will be used, one for each of the aforementioned flow curve components. To understand the difficulties involved in riverflow forecasting we first take a look at the relevant hydrological concepts and the data used in constructing and testing the forecasting method. We will principally be interested in the prediction of floods, as these phenomena can have dire socioeconomic consequences if they take place without a timely warning. Some of the forecasting models will be based on mathematical techniques derived from the field of artificial neural networks. As an introduction we will shortly elaborate on this field before presenting a more profound study of the two derived techniques we will use. These are the so-called `self-organizing maps' and `radial basis function networks'. An essential part of the forecasting method are linear and nonlinear regression models. We shall take a look at these parameterized prediction models, the associated prediction errors and the parameter estimation involved in constructing them. Thus being well prepared, we will have at this stage a close look at the Hydromax model and explain the forecasting method we have developed. They will be compared in terms of the data needed and the hydrological knowledge involved. Finally, we will show how the developed method is used in practice. The obtained results will be compared with those obtained by Hydromax, and remarks will be made about possible improvements. We will conclude with showing that the developed method holds promise, but is not yet suitable for practical applications. Suggestions for further research are also included.},

@THESIS{Quaeghebeur-PhD09b,
  ABSTRACT    = {This thesis's main subject is deriving, proposing, and studying predictive and parametric inference models that are based on the theory of coherent lower previsions. One important side subject also appears: obtaining and discussing extreme lower probabilities. In the chapter ‘Modeling uncertainty’, I give an introductory overview of the theory of coherent lower previsions ─ also called the theory of imprecise probabilities ─ and its underlying ideas. This theory allows us to give a more expressive ─ and a more cautious ─ description of uncertainty. This overview is original in the sense that ─ more than other introductions ─ it is based on the intuitive theory of coherent sets of desirable gambles. I show in the chapter ‘Extreme lower probabilities’ how to obtain the most extreme forms of uncertainty that can be modeled using lower probabilities. Every other state of uncertainty describable by lower probabilities can be formulated in terms of these extreme ones. The importance of the results in this area obtained and extensively discussed by me is currently mostly theoretical. The chapter ‘Inference models’ treats learning from samples from a finite, categorical space. My most basic assumption about the sampling process is that it is exchangeable, for which I give a novel definition in terms of desirable gambles. My investigation of the consequences of this assumption leads us to some important representation theorems: uncertainty about (in)finite sample sequences can be modeled entirely in terms of category counts (frequencies). I build on this to give an elucidating derivation from first principles for two popular inference models for categorical data ─ the predictive imprecise Dirichlet-multinomial model and the parametric imprecise Dirichlet model; I apply these models to game theory and learning Markov chains. In the last chapter, ‘Inference models for exponential families’, I enlarge the scope to exponential family sampling models; examples are normal sampling and Poisson sampling. I first thoroughly investigate exponential families and the related conjugate parametric and predictive previsions used in classical Bayesian inference models based on conjugate updating. These previsions serve as a basis for the new imprecise-probabilistic inference models I propose. Compared to the classical Bayesian approach, mine allows to be much more cautious when trying to express what we know about the sampling model; this caution is reflected in behavior (conclusions drawn, predictions made, decisions made) based on these models. Lastly, I show how the proposed inference models can be used for classification with the naive credal classifier.},

  ABSTRACT   = {A causal network is used in a number of areas as a depiction of patterns of `influence' among sets of variables. In expert systems it is common to perform `inference' by means of local computations on such large but sparse networks. In general, non-probabilistic methods are used to handle uncertainty when propagating the effects of evidence, and it has appeared that exact probabilistic methods are not computationally feasible. Motivated by an application in electromyography, we counter this claim by exploiting a range of local representations for the joint probability distribution, combined with topological changes to the original network termed `marrying' and `filling-in'. The resulting structure allows efficient algorithms for transfer between representations, providing rapid absorption and propagation of evidence. The scheme is first illustrated on a small, fictitious but challenging example, and the underlying theory and computational aspects are then discussed.},

Under this interpretation, possibility measures should satisfy two consistency criteria, known as ‘avoiding sure loss’ and ‘coherence’. We survey the rules that have been proposed for defining conditional possibilities and investigate which of them satisfy our consistency criteria in two situations of practical interest. Only two of these rules satisfy the criteria in both cases studied, and the conditional possibilities produced by these rules are highly uninformative. We introduce a new rule that is more informative and is also coherent in both cases.},

  ABSTRACT = {The number of knowledge-based systems that build on Bayesian belief networks is increasing. The construction of such a network however requires a large number of probabilities in numerical form. This is often considered a major obstacle, one of the reasons being that experts are reluctant to provide numerical probabilities. The use of verbal probability expressions as an additional method of eliciting probabilistic information may to some extent remove this obstacle. In this paper, we review studies that address the communication of probabilities in words and/or numbers. We then describe our own experiments concerning the development of a probability scale that contains words as well as numbers. This scale appears to be an aid for researchers and domain experts during the elicitation phase of building a belief network and might help users understand the output of the network.},

  ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we consider coherent imprecise probability assessments on finite families of conditional events and we study the problem of their extension. With this aim, we adopt a generalized definition of coherence, called g-coherence, which is based on a suitable generalization of the coherence principle of de Finetti. At first, we recall some theoretical results and an algorithm obtained in some previous papers where the case of precise conditional probability assessments has been studied. Then, we extend these results to the case of imprecise probabilistic assessments and we obtain a theorem which can be looked at as a generalization of the version of the fundamental theorem of de Finetti given by some authors for the case of conditional events. Our algorithm can also be exploited to produce lower and upper probabilities which are coherent in the sense of Walley and Williams. Moreover, we compare our approach to similar ones, like probability logic or probabilistic deduction. Finally, we apply our algorithm to some well-known inference rules assuming some logical relations among the given events.},

  ABSTRACT = {Numerical possibility measures can be interpreted as systems of upper betting rates for events. As such, they have a special part in the unifying behavioural theory of imprecise probabilities, proposed by Walley. On this interpretation, they should arguably satisfy certain rationality, or consistency, requirements, such as avoiding sure loss and coherence. Using a version of Walley's notion of epistemic independence suitable for possibility measures, we study in detail what these rationality requirements tell us about the construction of independent product possibility measures from given marginals, and we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for a product to satisfy these criteria. In particular, we show that the well-known minimum and product rules for forming independent joint distributions from marginal ones, are only coherent when at least one of these distributions assume just the values zero and one.},

  ABSTRACT = {A qualitative probabilistic network is a graphical model of the probabilistic influences among a set of statistical variables, in which each influence is associated with a qualitative sign. A non-monotonic influence between two variables is associated with the ambiguous sign ‘?’, which indicates that the actual sign of the influence depends on the state of the network. The presence of such ambiguous signs is undesirable as it tends to lead to uninformative results upon inference. In this paper, we argue that, although a non-monotonic influence may have varying effects, in each specific state of the network, its effect is unambiguous. To capture the current effect of the influence, we introduce the concept of situational sign. We show how situational signs can be used upon inference and how they are updated as the state of the network changes. By means of a real-life qualitative network in oncology, we show that the use of situational signs can effectively forestall uninformative results upon inference.},

  ABSTRACT = {Two classes of imprecise previsions, which we termed convex and centered convex previsions, are studied in this paper in a framework close to Walley's and Williams' theory of imprecise previsions. We show that convex previsions are related with a concept of convex natural extension, which is useful in correcting a large class of inconsistent imprecise probability assessments, characterised by a condition of avoiding unbounded sure loss. Convexity further provides a conceptual framework for some uncertainty models and devices, like unnormalised supremum preserving functions. Centered convex previsions are intermediate between coherent previsions and previsions avoiding sure loss, and their not requiring positive homogeneity is a relevant feature for potential applications. We discuss in particular their usage in (financial) risk measurement. In a final part we introduce convex imprecise previsions in a conditional environment and investigate their basic properties, showing how several of the preceding notions may be extended and the way the generalised Bayes rule applies.},

  ABSTRACT = {This paper addresses the problem of exchanging uncertainty assessments in multi-agent systems. Since it is assumed that each agent might completely ignore the internal representation of its partners, a common interchange format is needed. We analyze the case of an interchange format defined by means of imprecise probabilities, pointing out the reasons of this choice. A core problem with the interchange format concerns transformations from imprecise probabilities into other formalisms (in particular, precise probabilities, possibilities, belief functions). We discuss this so far little investigated question, analyzing how previous proposals, mostly regarding special instances of imprecise probabilities, would fit into this problem. We then propose some general transformation procedures, which take also account of the fact that information can be partial, i.e. may concern an arbitrary (finite) set of events.},

  ABSTRACT = {We consider the problem of learning the parameters of a Bayesian network from data, while taking into account prior knowledge about the signs of influences between variables. Such prior knowledge can be readily obtained from domain experts. We show that this problem of parameter learning is a special case of isotonic regression and provide a simple algorithm for computing isotonic estimates. Our experimental results for a small Bayesian network in the medical domain show that taking prior knowledge about the signs of influences into account leads to an improved fit of the true distribution, especially when only a small sample of data is available. More importantly, however, the isotonic estimator provides parameter estimates that are consistent with the specified prior knowledge, thereby resulting in a network that is more likely to be accepted by experts in its domain of application.},

  ABSTRACT = {In many real-life situations, we only have partial information about the actual probability distribution. For example, under Dempster-Shafer uncertainty, we only know the masses m1,...,mn assigned to different sets S1,...,Sn, but we do not know the distribution within each set Si. Because of this uncertainty, there are many possible probability distributions consistent with our knowledge; different distributions have, in general, different values of standard statistical characteristics such as mean and variance. It is therefore desirable, given a Dempster-Shafer knowledge base, to compute the ranges and of possible values of mean E and of variance V. In their recent paper, Langewisch and Choobineh show how to compute these ranges in polynomial time. In particular, they reduce the problem of computing to the problem of minimizing a convex quadratic function, a problem which can be solved in time O(n^2 log(n)). We show that the corresponding quadratic optimization problem can be actually solved faster, in time O(n log(n)); thus, we can compute the bounds V and in time O(n log(n)).},

  ABSTRACT   = {This article presents a probabilistic logic whose sentences can be interpreted as asserting the acceptability of gambles described in terms of an underlying logic. This probabilistic logic has a concrete syntax and a complete inference procedure, and it handles conditional as well as unconditional probabilities. It synthesizes Nilsson's probabilistic logic and Frisch and Haddawy's anytime inference procedure with Wilson and Moral's logic of gambles. Two distinct semantics can be used for our probabilistic logic: (1) the measure-theoretic semantics used by the prior logics already mentioned and also by the more expressive logic of Fagin, Halpern, and Meggido and (2) a behavioral semantics. Under the measure-theoretic semantics, sentences of our probabilistic logic are interpreted as assertions about a probability distribution over interpretations of the underlying logic. Under the behavioral semantics, these sentences are interpreted only as asserting the acceptability of gambles, and this suggests different directions for generalization.},

  ABSTRACT = {The paper presents an efficient solution to decision problems where direct partial information on the distribution of the states of nature is available, either by observations of previous repetitions of the decision problem or by direct expert judgements. To process this information we use a recent generalization of Walley's imprecise Dirichlet model, allowing us also to handle incomplete observations or imprecise judgements, including missing data. We derive efficient algorithms and discuss properties of the optimal solutions with respect to several criteria, including Gamma-maximinity and E-admissibility. In the case of precise data and pure actions the former surprisingly leads us to a frequency-based variant of the Hodges–Lehmann criterion, which was developed in classical decision theory as a compromise between Bayesian and minimax procedures.},

  ABSTRACT = {The personalist conception of probability is often explicated in terms of betting rates acceptable to an individual. A common approach, that of de Finetti for example, assumes that the individual is willing to take either side of the bet, so that the bet is “fair” from the individual's point of view. This can sometimes be unrealistic, and leads to difficulties in the case of conditional probabilities or previsions. An alternative conception is presented in which it is only assumed that the collection of acceptable bets forms a convex cone, rather than a linear space. This leads to the more general conception of an upper conditional prevision. The main concerns of the paper are with the extension of upper conditional previsions. The main result is that any upper conditional prevision is the upper envelope of a family of additive conditional previsions.},

Building upon the rate of the convergence, we further show that, given some wished-for level of accuracy, part of the inference can be forestalled. To evaluate our theoretical results, we study their implications for a real-life model from the medical domain and for a benchmark model for agricultural purposes. Our results indicate that whenever consecutive similar observations arise, the computational requirements of inference in Markovian models can be drastically reduced.},

  ABSTRACT = {Credal networks are models that extend Bayesian nets to deal with imprecision in probability, and can actually be regarded as sets of Bayesian nets. Credal nets appear to be powerful means to represent and deal with many important and challenging problems in uncertain reasoning. We give examples to show that some of these problems can only be modeled by credal nets called non-separately specified. These, however, are still missing a graphical representation language and updating algorithms. The situation is quite the opposite with separately specified credal nets, which have been the subject of much study and algorithmic development. This paper gives two major contributions. First, it delivers a new graphical language to formulate any type of credal network, both separately and non-separately specified. Second, it shows that any non-separately specified net represented with the new language can be easily transformed into an equivalent separately specified net, defined over a larger domain. This result opens up a number of new outlooks and concrete outcomes: first of all, it immediately enables the existing algorithms for separately specified credal nets to be applied to non-separately specified ones. We explore this possibility for the 2U algorithm: an algorithm for exact updating of singly connected credal nets, which is extended by our results to a class of non-separately specified models. We also consider the problem of inference on Bayesian networks, when the reason that prevents some of the variables from being observed is unknown. The problem is first reformulated in the new graphical language, and then mapped into an equivalent problem on a separately specified net. This provides a first algorithmic approach to this kind of inference, which is also proved to be NP-hard by similar transformations based on our formalism.},

We show that, as a consequence of the network’s independence properties, these sensitivity functions are highly constrained. We further investigate whether the patterns of sensitivity that follow from these functions support the observed robustness of naive Bayesian classifiers. In addition to standard sensitivities given available evidence, we also study the effect of parameter inaccuracies in view of scenarios of additional evidence.

We present the upper and lower probabilities for events involving the next observation and several of their properties. We also comment on differences between this NPI approach and corresponding inferences based on Walley's Imprecise Dirichlet Model.},

  ABSTRACT   = {We propose a new learning model for finite strategic-form two-player games based on fictitious play and Walley's imprecise Dirichlet model [P. Walley, Inferences from multinomial data: learning about a bag of marbles, J. Roy. Statist. Soc. B 58 (1996) 3–57]. This model allows the initial beliefs of the players about their opponent’s strategy choice to be near-vacuous or imprecise instead of being precisely defined. A similar generalization can be made as the one proposed by Fudenberg and Kreps [D. Fudenberg, D.M. Kreps, Learning mixed equilibria, Games Econ. Behav. 5 (1993) 320–367] for fictitious play, where assumptions about immediate behavior are replaced with assumptions about asymptotic behavior. We also obtain similar convergence results for this generalization: if there is convergence, it will be to an equilibrium.},

  ABSTRACT = {In many realistic problem domains, the main variable of interest behaves monotonically in the observable variables, in the sense that higher values for the variable of interest become more likely with higher-ordered observations. This type of knowledge appears to naturally emerge from experts during knowledge elicitation, without explicit prompting from the knowledge engineer. The experts’ concept of monotonicity, however, may not correspond to the mathematical concept of monotonicity in Bayesian networks. We present a method that provides both for verifying whether or not a network exhibits the properties of monotonicity suggested by the experts and for studying the violated properties with the experts. We illustrate the application of our method for a real Bayesian network in veterinary science.},

  ABSTRACT = {Credal networks are imprecise probabilistic graphical models generalizing Bayesian networks to convex sets of probability mass functions. This makes credal networks particularly suited to model expert knowledge under very general conditions, including states of qualitative and incomplete knowledge. In this paper, we present a credal network for risk evaluation in case of intrusion of civil aircrafts into a restricted flight area. The different factors relevant for this evaluation, together with an independence structure over them, are initially identified. These factors are observed by sensors, whose reliabilities can be affected by variable external factors, and even by the behaviour of the intruder. A model of these observation processes, and the necessary fusion scheme for the information returned by the sensors measuring the same factor, are both completely embedded into the structure of the credal network. A pool of experts, facilitated in their task by specific techniques to convert qualitative judgements into imprecise probabilistic assessments, has made possible the quantification of the network. We show the capabilities of the proposed model by means of some preliminary tests referred to simulated scenarios. Overall, we can regard this application as a useful tool to support military experts in their decision, but also as a quite general imprecise-probability paradigm for information fusion.},

  ABSTRACT = {Qualitative probabilistic networks (QPNs) are basically qualitative derivations of Bayesian belief networks. Originally, QPNs were designed to improve the speed of the construction and calculation of these networks, at the cost of specificity of the result. The formalism can also be used to facilitate cognitive mapping by means of inference in sign-based causal diagrams. Whatever the type of application, any computer based use of QPNs requires an algorithm capable of propagating information throughout the networks. Such an algorithm was developed in the 1990s. This polynomial time sign-propagation algorithm is explicitly or implicitly used in most existing QPN studies. This paper firstly shows that two types of undesired results may occur with the original sign-propagation algorithm: the results can be (1) less specific than possible at the given level of abstraction, or, more seriously (2) incorrect. Secondly, the paper identifies the causes underlying these problems. Thirdly, this paper presents an adapted sign-propagation algorithm. The worst-case running time of the adapted algorithm is still polynomial in the number of arrows. The results of the new algorithm have been compared with those of the original algorithm by applying both algorithms to a real-life constructed cognitive map. It is shown that the problems of the original algorithm are indeed prevented with the adapted algorithm.},

  ABSTRACT = {The parameters of Markov chain models are often not known precisely. Instead of ignoring this problem, a better way to cope with it is to incorporate the imprecision into the models. This has become possible with the development of models of imprecise probabilities, such as the interval probability model. In this paper we discuss some modelling approaches which range from simple probability intervals to the general interval probability models and further to the models allowing completely general convex sets of probabilities. The basic idea is that precisely known initial distributions and transition matrices are replaced by imprecise ones, which effectively means that sets of possible candidates are considered. Consequently, sets of possible results are obtained and represented using similar imprecise probability models. We first set up the model and then show how to perform calculations of the distributions corresponding to the consecutive steps of a Markov chain. We present several approaches to such calculations and compare them with respect to the accuracy of the results. Next we consider a generalisation of the concept of regularity and study the convergence of regular imprecise Markov chains. We also give some numerical examples to compare different approaches to calculations of the sets of probabilities.},

  ABSTRACT = {The next development in building Bayesian networks will most likely entail constructing multi-purpose models that can be employed for varying tasks and by different types of user. In this position paper, we argue that the development of a special type of ontology to organize the knowledge involved in such a multi-purpose model is crucial for the management of the model’s content. This ontology should preserve all knowledge elicited for the construction of the model and be accessible to domain experts and knowledge engineers alike. Based on the different ways in which people learn and gain expertise, we further argue that knowledge elicitation will result in task-specific knowledge mostly, which is best stored in the format in which it is elicited. To support varying model views for different tasks and different types of user, we propose that the elicited knowledge be organized in a library-style ontology of separate modules.},

  ABSTRACT = {Credal networks generalize Bayesian networks by relaxing the requirement of precision of probabilities. Credal networks are considerably more expressive than Bayesian networks, but this makes belief updating NP-hard even on polytrees. We develop a new efficient algorithm for approximate belief updating in credal networks. The algorithm is based on an important representation result we prove for general credal networks: that any credal network can be equivalently reformulated as a credal network with binary variables; moreover, the transformation, which is considerably more complex than in the Bayesian case, can be implemented in polynomial time. The equivalent binary credal network is then updated by L2U, a loopy approximate algorithm for binary credal networks. Overall, we generalize L2U to non-binary credal networks, obtaining a scalable algorithm for the general case, which is approximate only because of its loopy nature. The accuracy of the inferences with respect to other state-of-the-art algorithms is evaluated by extensive numerical tests.},

  ABSTRACT = {We focus on credal nets, which are graphical models that generalise Bayesian nets to imprecise probability. We replace the notion of strong independence commonly used in credal nets with the weaker notion of epistemic irrelevance, which is arguably more suited for a behavioural theory of probability. Focusing on directed trees, we show how to combine the given local uncertainty models in the nodes of the graph into a global model, and we use this to construct and justify an exact message-passing algorithm that computes updated beliefs for a variable in the tree. The algorithm, which is linear in the number of nodes, is formulated entirely in terms of coherent lower previsions, and is shown to satisfy a number of rationality requirements. We supply examples of the algorithm's operation, and report an application to on-line character recognition that illustrates the advantages of our approach for prediction. We comment on the perspectives, opened by the availability, for the first time, of a truly efficient algorithm based on epistemic irrelevance.},

However, much work remains to be done until the theory of desirable gambles can be considered as generally applicable to reasoning tasks as other approaches to imprecise probability are. This paper gives an overview of some of the fundamental concepts for reasoning with uncertainty expressed in terms of desirable gambles in the finite case, provides a characterization of regular extension, and studies the nature of maximally coherent sets of desirable gambles, which correspond to finite sequences of probability distributions, each one of them defined on the set where the previous one assigns probability zero.},

  ABSTRACT   = {Sensitivity analysis in hidden Markov models (HMMs) is usually performed by means of a perturbation analysis where a small change is applied to the model parameters, upon which the output of interest is re-computed. Recently it was shown that a simple mathematical function describes the relation between HMM parameters and an output probability of interest; this result was established by representing the HMM as a (dynamic) Bayesian network. To determine this sensitivity function, it was suggested to employ existing Bayesian network algorithms. Up till now, however, no special purpose algorithms for establishing sensitivity functions for HMMs existed. In this paper we discuss the drawbacks of computing HMM sensitivity functions, building only upon existing algorithms. We then present a new and efficient algorithm, which is specially tailored for determining sensitivity functions in HMMs.},

  ABSTRACT   = {Lower previsions defined on a finite set of gambles can be looked at as points in a finite-dimensional real vector space. Within that vector space, the sets of sure loss avoiding and coherent lower previsions form convex polyhedra. We present procedures for obtaining characterizations of these polyhedra in terms of a minimal, finite number of linear constraints. As compared to the previously known procedure, these procedures are more efficient and much more straightforward. Next, we take a look at a procedure for correcting incoherent lower previsions based on pointwise dominance. This procedure can be formulated as a multi-objective linear program, and the availability of the finite characterizations provide an avenue for making these programs computationally feasible.},

  ABSTRACT = {Graphical representations for probabilistic relationships have recently received considerable attention in AI. Qualitative probabilistic networks abstract from the usual numeric representations by encoding only qualitative relationships, which are inequality constraints on the joint probability distribution over the variables. Although these constraints are insufficient to determine probabilities uniquely, they are designed to justify the deduction of a class of relative likelihood conclusions that imply useful decision-making properties. Two types of qualitative relationship are defined, each a probabilistic form of monotonicity constraint over a group of variables. Qualitative influences describe the direction of the relationship between two variables. Qualitative synergies describe interactions among influences. The probabilistic definitions chosen justify sound and efficient inference procedures based on graphical manipulations of the network. These procedures answer queries about qualitative relationships among variables separated in the network and determine structural properties of optimal assignments to decision variables.},

Credal networks are graphical models for precise/imprecise beliefs. The main contribution of this work is a theory of credal networks that displays as much flexibility and representational power as the theory of standard Bayesian networks. Results in this paper show how to express judgements of irrelevance and independence, and how to compute inferences in credal networks. A credal network admits several extensions–several sets of probability measures comply with the constraints represented by a network. Two types of extensions are investigated. The properties of strong extensions are clarified through a new generalization of d-separation, and exact and approximate inference methods are described for strong extensions. Novel results are presented for natural extensions, and linear fractional programming methods are described for natural extensions. The paper also investigates credal networks that are defined globally through perturbations of a single network.},

  ABSTRACT = {Qualitative probabilistic networks were designed to overcome, to at least some extent, the quantification problem known to probabilistic networks. Qualitative networks abstract from the numerical probabilities of their quantitative counterparts by using signs to summarise the probabilistic influences between their variables. One of the major drawbacks of these qualitative abstractions, however, is the coarse level of representation detail that does not provide for indicating strengths of influences. As a result, the trade-offs modelled in a network remain unresolved upon inference. We present an enhanced formalism of qualitative probabilistic networks to provide for a finer level of representation detail. An enhanced qualitative probabilistic network differs from a basic qualitative network in that it distinguishes between strong and weak influences. Now, if a strong influence is combined, upon inference, with a conflicting weak influence, the sign of the net influence may be readily determined. Enhanced qualitative networks are purely qualitative in nature, as basic qualitative networks are, yet allow for resolving some trade-offs upon inference.},

  ABSTRACT = {There is no unique extension of the standard notion of probabilistic independence to the case where probabilities are indeterminate or imprecisely specified. Epistemic independence is an extension that formalises the intuitive idea of mutual irrelevance between different sources of information. This gives epistemic independence very wide scope as well as appeal: this interpretation of independence is often taken as natural also in precise-probabilistic contexts. Nevertheless, epistemic independence has received little attention so far. This paper develops the foundations of this notion for variables assuming values in finite spaces. We define (epistemically) independent products of marginals (or possibly conditionals) and show that there always is a unique least-committal such independent product, which we call the independent natural extension. We supply an explicit formula for it, and study some of its properties, such as associativity, marginalisation and external additivity, which are basic tools to work with the independent natural extension. Additionally, we consider a number of ways in which the standard factorisation formula for independence can be generalised to an imprecise-probabilistic context. We show, under some mild conditions, that when the focus is on least-committal models, using the independent natural extension is equivalent to imposing a so-called strong factorisation property. This is an important outcome for applications as it gives a simple tool to make sure that inferences are consistent with epistemic independence judgements. We discuss the potential of our results for applications in Artificial Intelligence by recalling recent work by some of us, where the independent natural extension was applied to graphical models. It has allowed, for the first time, the development of an exact linear-time algorithm for the imprecise probability updating of credal trees.},

We investigate how to combine a number of marginal coherent sets of desirable gambles into a joint set using the properties of epistemic irrelevance and independence. We provide formulas for the smallest such joint, called their independent natural extension, and study its main properties. The independent natural extension of maximal coherent sets of desirable gambles allows us to define the strong product of sets of desirable gambles. Finally, we explore an easy way to generalise these results to also apply for the conditional versions of epistemic irrelevance and independence. Having such a set of tools that are easily implemented in computer programs is clearly beneficial to fields, like AI, with a clear interest in coherent reasoning under uncertainty using general and robust uncertainty models that require no full specification.},

  ABSTRACT   = {This paper investigates Walley's concepts of epistemic irrelevance and epistemic independence for imprecise probability models. We study the mathematical properties of irrelevance and independence, and their relation to the graphoid axioms. Examples are given to show that epistemic irrelevance can violate the symmetry, contraction and intersection axioms, that epistemic independence can violate contraction and intersection, and that this accords with informal notions of irrelevance and independence.},

  ABSTRACT = {We solve two fundamental problems of probabilistic reasoning: given finitely many conditional probability assessments, how to determine whether the assessments are mutually consistent, and how to determine what they imply about the conditional probabilities of other events? These problems were posed in 1854 by George Boole, who gave a partial solution using algebraic methods. The two problems are fundamental in applications of the Bayesian theory of probability; Bruno de Finetti solved the second problem for the special case of unconditional probability assessments in what he called ‘the fundamental theorem of probability’. We give examples to show that previous attempts to solve the two problems, using probabilistic logic and similar methods, can produce incorrect answers. Using ideas from the theory of imprecise probability, we show that the general problems have simple, direct solutions which can be implemented using linear programming algorithms. Unlike earlier proposals, our methods are formulated directly in terms of the assessments, without introducing unknown probabilities. Our methods work when any of the conditioning events may have probability zero, and they work when the assessments include imprecise (upper and lower) probabilities or previsions. The main methodological contribution of the paper is to provide general algorithms for making inferences from any finite collection of (possibly imprecise) conditional probabilities.},

  ABSTRACT   = {We consider lower probabilities on finite possibility spaces as models for the uncertainty about the state. These generalizations of classical probabilities can have some interesting properties; for example: k-monotonicity, avoiding sure loss, coherence, permutation invariance. The sets formed by all the lower probabilities satisfying zero or more of these properties are convex. We show how the extreme points and rays of these sets – the extreme lower probabilities – can be calculated and we give an illustration of our results.},

  ABSTRACT   = {We investigate a constrained optimization problem with uncertainty about constraint parameters. Our aim is to reformulate it as a (constrained) optimization problem without uncertainty. This is done by recasting the original problem as a decision problem under uncertainty. We give results for a number of different types of uncertainty models—linear and vacuous previsions, and possibility distributions—and for two common but different optimality criteria for such decision problems—maximinity and maximality. We compare our approach with other approaches that have appeared in the literature.},

  ABSTRACT   = {When the initial and transition probabilities of a finite Markov chain in discrete time are not well known, we should perform a sensitivity analysis. This can be done by considering as basic uncertainty models the so-called credal sets that these probabilities are known or believed to belong to, and by allowing the probabilities to vary over such sets. This leads to the definition of an imprecise Markov chain. We show that the time evolution of such a system can be studied very efficiently using so-called lower and upper expectations, which are equivalent mathematical representations of credal sets. We also study how the inferred credal set about the state at time n evolves as n goes to infinity: under quite unrestrictive conditions, it converges to a uniquely invariant credal set, regardless of the credal set given for the initial state. This leads to a non-trivial generalisation of the classical Perron-Frobenius Theorem to imprecise Markov chains.},

  ABSTRACT   = {This paper develops a model of strategic communication, in which a better-informed Sender (S) sends a possibly noisy signal to a Receiver (R), who then takes an action that determines the welfare of both. We characterize the set of Bayesian Nash equilibria under standard assumptions, and show that equilibrium signaling always takes a strikingly simple form, in which S partitions the support of the (scalar) variable that represents his private information and introduces noise into his signal by reporting, in effect, only which element of the partition his observation actually lies in. We show under further assumptions that before S observes his private information, the equilibrium whose partition has the greatest number of elements is Pareto-superior to all other equilibria, and that if agents coordinate on this equilibrium, R's equilibrium expected utility rises when agents' preferences become more similar. Since R bases his choice of action on rational expectations, this establishes a sense in which equilibrium signaling is more informative when agents' preferences are more similar.},

  ABSTRACT = {When eliciting a probability model from experts, knowledge engineers may compare the results of the model with expert judgment on test scenarios, then adjust model parameters to bring the behavior of the model more in line with the experts intuition. This paper presents a methodology for analytic computation of sensitivity values in Bayesian network models. Sensitivity values are partial derivatives of output probabilities with respect to parameters being varied in the sensitivity analysis. They measure the impact of small changes in a network parameter on a target probability value or distribution. Sensitivity values can be used to focus knowledge elicitation effort on those parameters having the most impact on outputs of concern. Analytic sensitivity values are computed for an example and compared to sensitivity analysis by direct variation of parameters},

  ABSTRACT   = {When the initial and transition probabilities of a finite Markov chain in discrete time are not well known, we should perform a sensitivity analysis. This is done by considering as basic uncertainty models the so-called credal sets that these probabilities are known or believed to belong to, and by allowing the probabilities to vary over such sets. This leads to the definition of an imprecise Markov chain. We show that the time evolution of such a system can be studied very efficiently using so-called lower and upper expectations. We also study how the inferred credal set about the state at time n evolves as n goes to infinity: under quite unrestrictive conditions, it converges to a uniquely invariant credal set, regardless of the credal set given for the initial state. This leads to a non-trivial generalisation of the classical Perron–Frobenius Theorem to imprecise Markov chains.},

  ABSTRACT   = {The standard coherence criterion for lower previsions is expressed using an infinite number of linear constraints. For lower previsions that are essentially defined on some finite set of gambles on a finite possibility space, we present a reformulation of this criterion that only uses a finite number of constraints. Any such lower prevision is coherent if it lies within the convex polytope defined by these constraints. The vertices of this polytope are the extreme coherent lower previsions for the given set of gambles. Our reformulation makes it possible to compute them. We show how this is done and illustrate the procedure and its results.},

  ABSTRACT   = {We discuss two approaches for choosing a strategy in a two-player game. We suppose that the game is played a large number of rounds, which allows the players to use observations of past play to guide them in choosing a strategy. Central in these approaches is the way the opponent's next strategy is assessed; both a precise and an imprecise Dirichlet model are used. The observations of the opponent's past strategies can then be used to update the model and obtain new assessments. To some extent, the imprecise probability approach allows us to avoid making arbitrary initial assessments. To be able to choose a strategy, the assessment of the opponent's strategy is combined with rules for selecting an optimal response to it: a so-called best response or a maximin strategy. Together with the updating procedure, this allows us to choose strategies for all the rounds of the game. The resulting playing sequence can then be analysed to investigate if the strategy choices can converge to equilibria.},

  ABSTRACT   = {When considering sampling models described by a distribution from an exponential family, it is possible to create two types of imprecise probability models. One is based on the corresponding conjugate distribution and the other on the corresponding predictive distribution. In this paper, we show how these types of models can be constructed for any (regular, linear, canonical) exponential family, such as the centered normal distribution. To illustrate the possible use of such models, we take a look at credal classification. We show that they are very natural and potentially promising candidates for describing the attributes of a credal classifier, also in the case of continuous attributes.},

  ABSTRACT   = {We consider immediate predictive inference, where a subject, using a number of observations of a finite number of exchangeable random variables, is asked to coherently model his beliefs about the next observation, in terms of a predictive lower prevision. We study when such predictive lower previsions are representation insensitive, meaning that they are essentially independent of the choice of the (finite) set of possible values for the random variables. Such representation insensitive predictive models have very interesting properties, and among such models, the ones produced by the Imprecise Dirichlet-Multinomial Model are quite special in a number of ways.},

  ABSTRACT = {We present an efficient exact algorithm for estimating state sequences from outputs (or observations) in imprecise hidden Markov models (iHMM), where both the uncertainty linking one state to the next, and that linking a state to its output, are represented using coherent lower previsions. The notion of independence we associate with the credal network representing the iHMM is that of epistemic irrelevance. We consider as best estimates for state sequences the (Walley–Sen) maximal sequences for the posterior joint state model (conditioned on the observed output sequence), associated with a gain function that is the indicator of the state sequence. This corresponds to (and generalises) finding the state sequence with the highest posterior probability in HMMs with precise transition and output probabilities (pHMMs). We argue that the computational complexity is at worst quadratic in the length of the Markov chain, cubic in the number of states, and essentially linear in the number of maximal state sequences. For binary iHMMs, we investigate experimentally how the number of maximal state sequences depends on the model parameters.},

  ABSTRACT   = {Lower previsions defined on a finite set of gambles can be looked at as points in a finite-dimensional real vector space. Within that vector space, the sets of sure loss avoiding and coherent lower previsions form convex polyhedra. We present procedures for obtaining characterizations of these polyhedra in terms of a minimal, finite number of linear constraints. As compared to the previously known procedure, these procedures are more efficient and much more straightforward. Next, we take a look at a procedure for correcting incoherent lower previsions based on pointwise dominance. This procedure can be formulated as a multi-objective linear program, and the availability of the finite characterizations provide an avenue for making these programs computationally feasible.},

  ABSTRACT   = {We consider lower probabilities on finite possibility spaces as models for the uncertainty about the state. These generalizations of classical probabilities can have some interesting properties; for example: k-monotonicity, avoiding sure loss, coherence, permutation invariance. The sets formed by all the lower probabilities satisfying zero or more of these properties are convex. We show how the extreme points and rays of these sets – the extreme lower probabilities – can be calculated and we give an illustration of our results.},

  ABSTRACT   = {We give a definition for lower and upper covariance in Walley's theory of imprecise probabilities (or coherent lower previsions) that is direct, i.e., does not refer to credal sets. It generalizes Walley's definition for lower and upper variance. Just like Walley's definition of lower and upper variance, our definition for lower and upper covariance is compatible with the credal set approach; i.e., we also provide a covariance envelope theorem. Our approach mirrors the one taken by Walley: we first reformulate the calculation of a covariance as an optimization problem and then generalize this optimization problem to lower and upper previsions. We also briefly discuss the still unclear meaning of lower and upper (co)variances and mention some ideas about generalizations to other central moments.},

  ABSTRACT   = {Uncertainty models such as sets of desirable gambles and (conditional) lower previsions can be represented as convex cones. Checking the consistency of and drawing inferences from such models requires solving feasibility and optimization problems. We consider finitely generated such models. For closed cones, we can use linear programming; for conditional lower prevision-based cones, there is an efficient algorithm using an iteration of linear programs. We present an efficient algorithm for general cones that also uses an iteration of linear programs.},

  ABSTRACT   = {Drawing inferences from general lower probabilities on finite possibility spaces usually involves solving linear programming problems. For some applications this may be too computationally demanding. Some special classes of lower probabilities allow for using computationally less demanding techniques. One such class is formed by the completely monotone lower probabilities, for which inferences can be drawn efficiently once their Mö bius transform has been calculated. One option is therefore to draw approximate inferences by using a completely monotone approximation to a general lower probability; this must be an outer approximation to avoid drawing inferences that are not implied by the approximated lower probability. In this paper, we discuss existing and new algorithms for performing this approximation, discuss their relative strengths and weaknesses, and illustrate how each one works and performs.},

  ABSTRACT   = {We present a variant of the CONEstrip algorithm for checking whether the origin lies in a finitely generated convex cone that can be open, closed, or neither. This variant is designed to deal efficiently with problems where the rays defining the cone are specified as linear combinations of propositional sentences. The variant differs from the original algorithm in that we apply row generation techniques. The generator problem is WPMaxSAT, an optimization variant of SAT; both can be solved with specialized solvers or integer linear programming techniques. We additionally show how optimization problems over the cone can be solved by using our propositional CONEstrip algorithm as a preprocessor. The algorithm is designed to support consistency and inference computations within the theory of sets of desirable gambles. We also make a link to similar computations in probabilistic logic, conditional probability assessments, and imprecise probability theory.},

  ABSTRACT     = {This paper deals with belief models, and in particular lower previsions, for both (finite) collections and (infinite) sequences of exchangeable random variables taking a finite number of values. When such collections or sequences are assumed to be exchangeable, this more or less means that their specific order is irrelevant. We show that exchangeable lower previsions can be written as a combination of (i) a coherent prevision expressing that permutations of realisations of such collections or sequences are considered equally likely, and (ii) a coherent lower prevision for the `frequency' of occurrence of the different values the random variables can take. This is the essence of representation in de Finetti's sense: we generalise his results to coherent lower previsions, both for finite collections and infinite sequences. We also solve a more practical problem: how to extend a number of lower prevision assessments to an exchangeable lower prevision that is as conservative as possible.},

  ABSTRACT   = {We consider the problem of modelling the load on a bridge pillar when hit by a vehicle. This load depends on a number of uncertain variables, such as the mass of the vehicle and its speed on impact. The objective of our study is to analyse their effect on the load. More specifically, we are interested in finding the minimum distance of the pillar to the side of the road passing under the bridge such that a given constraint on the load is satisfied in 99\% of impact cases, i.e., such that the probability of satisfying the constraint is 0.99. In addition, we look for solutions to the following optimisation problem: find the distance that minimises a given cost function while still satisfying a given constraint on the load. This optimisation problem under uncertain constraints is not a well-posed problem, so we turn it into a decision problem under uncertainty. For both problems, we consider two typical cases. In the first, so-called precise-probability case, all uncertain variables involved are modelled using probability distributions, and in the second, so-called imprecise-probability case, the uncertainty for at least some of the variables (in casu the mass) is modelled by an interval of possible values, which is a special imprecise-probabilistic model. In the first case, we compute the joint distribution using simple Monte Carlo simulation, and in the second case, we combine Monte Carlo simulation with newly developed techniques in the field of imprecise probabilities. For the optimisation problem with uncertain constraints, this leads to two distinct approaches with different optimality criteria, namely maximality and maximinity, which we discuss and compare.},

  ABSTRACT   = {The criteria that characterize many interesting classes of lower previsions, such as coherent or k-monotone lower probabilities, can in finite spaces often be seen as a set of linear constraints on the set of lower previsions in the class, which therefore is a convex polyhedron. It can be equivalently characterized by its set of vertices. For all interesting classes that I studied, the set of vertices or necessary and sufficient constraints is finite. In the presentation I aim to make these representations a bit more concrete to people, so that their possible uses – both in applications and theory – can be discussed in a tangible way.},

  ABSTRACT   = {Uncertainty and preference is often modeled using linear previsions and linear orders. Some more expressive models use sets of probabilities, lower previsions, or partial orders (see, e.g., the work of Seidenfeld et al. and Walley). In the discussion of these more expressive models, or even to justify them, alternative representations in terms of sets of so-called acceptable, favorable, or desirable gambles appear (cf. the work of Williams, Seidenfeld et al., and Walley). Such ‘sets of gambles’-based models are attractive because of their geometric nature. We generalize these ‘sets of gambles’-based models by considering a pair of sets, one with accepted gambles and one with rejected gambles. We develop a framework based on a small number of axioms—No Confusion, Deductive Closure, No Limbo, and Indifference to Status Quo—and provide an interesting characterization of the resulting models. Furthermore, we define a pair of equivalent gamble relations that generalize the partial orders mentioned earlier; the corresponding characterization result is also given.},

  ABSTRACT   = {A method of command line completion based on probabilistic models is described. The method supplements the existing deterministic ones. The probabilistic models are developed within the context of imprecise probabilities. An imprecise Dirichlet model is used to represent the assessments about all possible completions and to allow for learning by observing the commands typed previously. Due to the use of imprecise probabilities a partial (instead of a linear) ordering of the possible completion actions will be constructed during decision making. Markov models can additionally be incorporated to take recurring sequences of commands into account.},

  ABSTRACT   = {The objective of our research is first of all the development of a method for learning the transition probabilities in (possibly hidden) Markov models using imprecise probabilities, and next the application of this method to some real-life problems. The learning model used will be the imprecise Dirichlet model, an extension of the precise Dirichlet model to the theory of imprecise probabilities. Possible applications are gene-sequence alignment and pre-fetching of web pages.},

  ABSTRACT   = {An imprecise Markov chain is defined by a closed convex set of transition matrices instead of a unique one for a classical precise Markov chain. These imprecise Markov chains allow us to model situations where we do not have enough information to specify a unique transition matrix, or to approximate the behaviour of non‐stationary Markov chains. We show that there are efficient, dynamic programming‐ like ways to work and reason with these imprecise Markov chains; e.g. to calculate the resulting distribution over the states at any time instant. We prove that this distribution converges in time, similarly to the precise case and under very mild conditions. We thus effectively prove a Perron-Frobenius theorem for a special class of non‐linear systems.},

  ABSTRACT   = {Event trees are a graphical model of a set of possible situations and the possible paths going through them, from the initial situation to the terminal situations. With each situation, there is associated a local uncertainty model that represents beliefs about the next situation. The uncertainty models can be classical, precise probabilities; they can also be of a more general, imprecise probabilistic type, in which case they can be seen as sets of classical probabilities (yielding probability intervals). To work with such event trees, we must combine these local uncertainty models. We show this can be done efficiently by back-propagation through the tree, both for precise and imprecise probabilistic models, and we illustrate this using an imprecise probabilistic counterpart of the classical Markov chain. This allows us to perform a robustness analysis for Markov chains very efficiently.},

  ABSTRACT   = {We replace strong independence in credal networks with the weaker notion of epistemic irrelevance. Focusing on directed trees, we show how to combine the local credal sets in the networks into an overall joint model, and use this to construct and justify an exact message-passing algorithm that computes updated beliefs for a variable in the network. The algorithm, which is essentially linear in the number of nodes, is formulated entirely in terms of coherent lower previsions. We supply examples of the algorithm's operation, and report an application to on-line character recognition that illustrates the advantages of the model for prediction.},

  ABSTRACT   = {The standard coherence criterion for lower previsions is expressed using an infinite number of linear constraints. For lower previsions that are essentially defined on some finite set of gambles on a finite possibility space, we present a reformulation of this criterion that only uses a finite number of constraints. Any such lower prevision is coherent if it lies within the convex polytope defined by these constraints. The vertices of this polytope are the extreme coherent lower previsions for the given set of gambles. Our reformulation makes it possible to compute them. We show how this is done and illustrate the procedure and its results.},
